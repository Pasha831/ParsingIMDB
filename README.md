# ParsingIMDb
My name is Pasha.

I am learning Data Science on Coursera site and have some free time to practice with parcing web sites.

Here i am parcing <a href='https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?groups=top_1000&sort=user_rating,desc&count=100&ref_=adv_nxt'>IMDb raiting</a> - 1000 top films of all the time.

<hr>

## Objectives:
* earn experience in parsing web pages
* earn experience in Data Science
* get some basics of Data Science analytics
* try to visualize data that i will get
* try to tell you a brief story on the insights i'll get

**Fasten seat belts, we take off!**

## Getting started
First of all, i found a great IMDb database about Top-1000 films in human history.

I chose it because it was:
* easy to parce *(but not always :D)*
* easy to understand
* easy to make a stories based on result of this database

## Steps of work
I've parced it in my .py file making these steps:
1. made a request to IMDb site to get text version of this page
2. import libraries such as Pandas, BeautifulSoup and Requests to handle with data
3. parced all 1000 rows of a table
4. extarct useful info into a Pandas dataframe
5. export dataframe data to .csv file to read and to work with it later

## What am i going to do now?
That's a good question and i have some answers for you.

Here is the small list of inforamtion, that i want extract from data which i obtained:
1. Is there any relationship between length of the name of the film and gross sums or rating of film?
2. Which era was the most eventful in the film industry?
3. Which era of film indusrty was teeming with profits?
4. How much films were created each year? (is there any areas of decline or growth of the industry?)
5. How is changing length of the film during years?
6. How is changing gross of the film during years?
7. Whats the realtionship between length of the film and the year when it was created?
8. more questions will appear in future ðŸ˜…

## Analyzing the data
Here we are going to tell about all 7 (or more questions), using my ability to tell stories and making graphs (which now is not really good ðŸ˜Ÿ)
